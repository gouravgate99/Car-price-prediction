# Gradient Boosting Regression Implementation

##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Gradient Boosting Regression** to model
complex nonlinear relationships in data. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model
training, and performance evaluation using standard regression metrics.

---

##  Dataset
- The dataset is loaded and explored within the notebook.
- It contains numerical features suitable for regression analysis.
- Feature scaling and preprocessing steps are applied before model training.

---

##  Algorithm Used

### 🔹 Gradient Boosting Regressor
- Ensemble learning technique that builds models sequentially
- Each new model corrects errors made by previous models
- Effective for capturing nonlinear patterns in data
